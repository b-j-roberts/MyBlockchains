# Naive Blockchain POW

Contains an implementation of a naive POW blockchain. Used to practice basics of libp2p and dig deeper into the mechanics of POW systems.

Does not store accounts, but each block only stores 1 integer data.

Code is kinda messy, but acted as base for learning & creating `naive-cryptocurrency-pow`
